# BitBucket to GitHub

We have migrated the frbcat private repository from Bitbucket to two public repositories in GitHub.

The URL of the Bitbucket repository is https://bitbucket.org/account/signin/?next=/andrew_jameson/frbcat

It has been split in two repositories in GitHub, one for the DB code and the other for the web UI.

The two repositories in GitHub are in a new GitHub organization called AA-ALERT. Jisk, Ronald, Oscar and Emily have beed added as members of the organization.

The URL of the organization is: https://github.com/AA-ALERT

The URLs of the two repositories are:

https://github.com/AA-ALERT/frbcatdb

https://github.com/AA-ALERT/frbcatweb
