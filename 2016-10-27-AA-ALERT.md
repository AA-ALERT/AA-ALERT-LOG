# AA-ALERT meeting 27/10/2016

present: Ronald, Emily, Oscar

## Discussion points
* right ascension/declination in dms i n frb -> convert to degree (voevent xml needs degrees (float)) -> store both in degrees and dms
* Add reference to frbcat for telescope description? -> add to catalog
* Coord system: add to database? What is current coord system used for database entries? What to do with different coord systems (convert?, howto?) -> store/conversion, emily looks into it
* Currently params have no units, what are the units of the params in the database?
* Do we want to use a more descriptive name for params than the name of the row in frbcat, if so which?
* Seems good practice to add a Unified Content Descriptor to params. Do we have these for our params?
* Current database entries have no author information, this is needed to create a valid voevent xml -> set manually to unkown in database
* Citations of other events: are these added to the publications table, if so which type to use? -> need to add citation to database

check for uniqueness:
frbs: name
observations: telescope &utc & type
rop: add setting_id (string) to rop
rmp: voevent_ivorn
