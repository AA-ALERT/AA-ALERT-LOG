# AA-Alert kick-off meeting
###### when: 2016-03-31 11:00 - 12:30
###### where: Netherlands eScience Center

## Round of introductions

### Jisk Attema
NLeSC coordinator / engineer. background physics (theoretical and applied)
Will be working on the GPU ("accelerate") part of the project.

### Rob van Nieuwpoort
Director of Technology NLeSC

### Oscar Martinez Rubi
Masters in Astrophysics, 3 year at space mission / GAIA (barcelona), lofar group data manager, pointclouds
Will be working on the data ("access") part of the project

### Emily Petroff
ASTRON, Postdoc
PhD Center for Astrophysics and supercomputing in australia; was involved with the discovery and/or search for FRBs before.

### Joeri van Leeuwen:
API/ASTRON PI on the project

### Klim Mikhailov
Bachelor in high-energy / theoretical physics.
Masters in astronomy, molecular physics, computing (UVA/VU)
PhD at UVA / ASTRON

## NLeSC projects
Jisk gives a presentation on the NLeSC projects, way of working, overhead, etc. Slides attached for reference.
He will also do the NLeSC coordination of the project; contact him with questions regarding engineers, administration, ..., research proposals, ...?

## AA-Alert
Joeri gives a presentation on the AA-Alert project.


## Discussion

### start date
The telescope is commissioning at 2016-09-01, and some people still have to be hired for the project; Joeri prefers to start at 1st of September.
The official NLeSC start date is 1st of July at the latest. We will try to rearrange the planning such that we can soon; at least within a few months.
Note that Oscar has indicated he would like to move back to Spain at the start of 2017. A replacement engineer will be found, but it would be nice if he could do a large part of the work before then. To complicate matters, he will be absent for private reasons in June.

### On location
The work in the project will have to be done at location, which is mostly Dwingelo. NLeSC engineers are typically around 40 to 60% of the time at location: This will mean a lot of traveling, but with planning, (fi. every second week a few days on location) this should be doable.

### Virtual Observatory
After discussion, it seems that the virtual observatory work is less GUI oriented, and more technical / API based, than we (nlesc) thought.
This means that the engineer we had intended to do that part of the project is not the best option; we will reconsider

### GPU cluster / CUDA
Joeri is in the process of ordering a compute cluster. He asks for advice on what machine to buy (basically, opencl or cuda). Joeri will discuss this off-line with Rob and/or Ben van Werkhoven.
